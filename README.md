# Project-1: 
## Topic-1: Linux Networking Firewalls and Routing
### What is Firewall?
* A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls act as barriers between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network such as the internet. They are used to protect a network from unauthorized access, malware, and other network security threats.

### Need of Firewall
1. **Protection from external threats**: Firewalls can help to protect a network from external threats such as malware, hackers, and malicious software.
2. **Control access to a network**: Firewalls can be used to control access to a network by blocking or limiting certain types of traffic.
3. **Enforce security policies**: Firewalls can be used to enforce security policies such as requiring authentication for certain types of access or prohibiting the use of certain types of software.
4. **Improve network performance**: Firewalls can help to improve network performance by blocking traffic that is not needed, such as spam or other types of unwanted traffic.

Overall, firewalls are an important part of a defense-in-depth security strategy and can help to protect a network from external threats and enforce security policies.

### Firewall
* A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.

### Why do we use firewall
We use firewall because there are always new cybersecurity threats.which can impact both large companies and individuals. For every improved steps in cybersecurity take ten. And while you can always try to assess to website's safety, a firewall casts a much wider security net.

### Features of firewall
1. **Monitoring traffic**: A firewall works constantly to monitor your traffic based on specifically defined rules. Without a firewall acting as a security guard for your traffic, your network, devices, and personal data are exposed.
2. **Stopping online attacks**: While IT technicians work to secure data in a comapany's network and maintain a firewall's network security, pirates armed with malware and other threats seek to obtain that data and sell it a hefty sum. Without a firewall, it is easire for malware to slip through the cracks in the network.
3. **Preventing hacks and data loss**: IT technicians and antivirus software developers work around the clock to keep hackers from gaining access to private data. Without a firewall, your device, your data are left exposed. If cybercriminals get access, it can lead to leaked confidential data, fraud, or even identity theft.
4. **Improve network performance**: Firewalls can help to improve network performance by blocking traffic that is not needed, such as spam or other types of unwanted traffic.

### Implementation of Firewall in Linux:
* **Netfilter**: Netfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that allows various networking-related operations to be implemented in the form of customized handlers.
* **iptables**: The iptables command is a powerful interface for your local Linux firewall. It provides thousands of network traffic management options through a simple syntax.
* **nftables**: nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames.
* **Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)**: Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) is a program for managing a netfilter firewall designed to be easy to use. It uses a command-line interface consisting of a small number of simple commands, and uses iptables for configuration.
* **Firewalld**: Firewalld can restrict access to services, ports, and networks. You can block specific subnets and IP addresses. As with any firewall, firewalld inspects all traffic traversing the various interfaces on your system.
* **Shorewall**: Shorewall is a gateway/firewall configuration tool for GNU/Linux. It is a higher-level firewall management utility that simplifies the process of configuring iptables rules.

## Topic-2: DNS

1. Why do we use DNS & features of DNS
2. How are all the features in DNS implemented.

* **Domain Name System** (DNS) is a decentralized system that converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to communicate with each other.
* DNS is essentially a translator between what people want and what a netWhy do we use firewall

We use firewall because there are always new cybersecurity threats.which can impact both large companies and individuals. For every improved steps in cybersecurity take ten. And while you can always try to assess to website's safety, a firewall casts a much wider security net.work needsto make that happen.
* The DNS servers store and manage the mapping of domain names to IP addresses, and respond to DNS queries from clients, such as web browsers.
* In the reverse direction, DNS can also translate an IP address into a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), using what's called a pointer (PTR) request (for a DNS PTR record) or "reverse lookup". This can be important to technical folks, but these requests are not as commonly seen by regular people running their browsers and other applications.
