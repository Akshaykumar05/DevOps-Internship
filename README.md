## Project-1: Linux Networking Firewalls and Routing
### What is Firewall?
* A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls act as barriers between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network such as the internet. They are used to protect a network from unauthorized access, malware, and other network security threats.
