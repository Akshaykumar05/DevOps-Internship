## Project-1: Linux Networking Firewalls and Routing
### What is Firewall?
* A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls act as barriers between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network such as the internet. They are used to protect a network from unauthorized access, malware, and other network security threats.

### Need of Firewall
1. **Protection from external threats**: Firewalls can help to protect a network from external threats such as malware, hackers, and malicious software.
2. **Control access to a network**: Firewalls can be used to control access to a network by blocking or limiting certain types of traffic.
3. **Enforce security policies**: Firewalls can be used to enforce security policies such as requiring authentication for certain types of access or prohibiting the use of certain types of software.
4. **Improve network performance**: Firewalls can help to improve network performance by blocking traffic that is not needed, such as spam or other types of unwanted traffic.

Overall, firewalls are an important part of a defense-in-depth security strategy and can help to protect a network from external threats and enforce security policies.

### Features of Firewall

1. How are all the features in firewall implemented

### Firewall
* A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.

### Iptables.
### Nftables.

## 2nd Topic of 1st project: DNS
* **Domain Name System** (DNS) is a decentralized system that converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to communicate with each other.
* DNS is essentially a translator between what people want and what a network needsto make that happen.
* The DNS servers store and manage the mapping of domain names to IP addresses, and respond to DNS queries from clients, such as web browsers.
* In the reverse direction, DNS can also translate an IP address into a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), using what's called a pointer (PTR) request (for a DNS PTR record) or "reverse lookup". This can be important to technical folks, but these requests are not as commonly seen by regular people running their browsers and other applications.
