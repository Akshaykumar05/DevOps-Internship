## Project-1: Linux Networking Firewalls and Routing
### What is Firewall?
* A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls act as barriers between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network such as the internet. They are used to protect a network from unauthorized access, malware, and other network security threats.

### Need of Firewall
1. **Protection from external threats**: Firewalls can help to protect a network from external threats such as malware, hackers, and malicious software.
2. **Control access to a network**: Firewalls can be used to control access to a network by blocking or limiting certain types of traffic.
3. **Enforce security policies**: Firewalls can be used to enforce security policies such as requiring authentication for certain types of access or prohibiting the use of certain types of software.
4. **Improve network performance**: Firewalls can help to improve network performance by blocking traffic that is not needed, such as spam or other types of unwanted traffic.

Overall, firewalls are an important part of a defense-in-depth security strategy and can help to protect a network from external threats and enforce security policies.
